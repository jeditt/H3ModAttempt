# H3VR Twitch hooks

H3VR mod to hook into twich for some wacky situations! Developed by [JediTobiWan](https://www.youtube.com/c/jeditobiwan/) as a way to learn modding!

Current implemented features:
- On space bar press, time slows down
- On H press, spawn tippy toy above player's head
- On J press, spawn Body Pillow (currently above player's head)
- On K press, spawn and prime a flash grenade

This is meant to be used in junction with InstructBot (or similar) which allows Twitch events to be passed as a keyboard press into the active window.

Infinite thanks to nrgill28 & frityet for their help with this.
